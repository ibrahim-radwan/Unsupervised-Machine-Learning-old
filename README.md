<img src=/images/cover.png width=500, height="350">

In this repository, the code snippets will be added for the activities and practices to gain skill on using unsupervised machine learning. This will include topics such as:
- Clustering (KMeans, GMMs, DBSCAN, etc.)
- Dimentionality Reduction (PCS, tSNE, etc.)
- Association Rules
- Auto-Encoder

The code is written in Python language and are embedded into multiple Jupyter Notebooks. There is a data folder that includes multiple data files to be called while running the code inside the notebooks.
